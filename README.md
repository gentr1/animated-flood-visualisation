# animated-flood-visualisation
small light-weight webGL code allowing the visualisation of animated flood from pictures
### Demo available at: http://nexus-serious-games.org/mini-caddies-0/millbrook-flood-basic.html
If you open the .html page in the project called millbrook-flood-basic.html with a recent web browser, you will see the 3d flood visualisation.

It is recommended to use Chrome with the  --allow-file-access-from-files flag to view it so that the local can read loca files, if not, you can always use firefox.

The webgl viewer use the files located in \depth-data\MillBrook\outs\millbrook-flood-1.png and  \depth-data\MillBrook\outs\millbrook-flood-2.png to create a 3d linear morphing of the 3d surface floods between the 2 states.

millbrook-flood-1.png is an image where each pixel r g b a values represent a 32bits integer representing the height of the terrain.

millbrook-flood-2.png is generated through cadflood , giving the result of flooding height and converting it to the same iamge format.

The millbrook-flood-2.png image is generated by running the pythonscript \depth-data\MillBrook\RunCaddiesMillBrock.py : 

```python RunCaddiesMillBrock.py -addtional_Flood_Height 2.0 -zero_noFlood 0.1 -GPU``` if you have a GPU

or 

```python RunCaddiesMillBrock.py -addtional_Flood_Height 2.0 -zero_noFlood 0.1``` if you don't have one.

(calculation time under a minute !!)

Note that in order to execute the python script you need to have numpy installed and also GDAL and python bindings.
To install GDAL and Python bindings on windows , follow the instructions at : http://cartometric.com/blog/2011/10/17/install-gdal-on-windows/. Install numpy with unofficial binaries here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy by doing ```pip install "location_of_whl_file\file.whl"```.
